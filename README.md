# Combat & Movement Overhaul (CMO)
This is an overhaul for Minetest's movement system.

## Features

### CMO Attack Overhaul
- elevated attacks do additional knockback
- backstabs (punches within 90Â° angle opposed to look direction) do double damage
- bonus damage based on relative movement speed
- missed swings cost 20% stamina
- no damage dealt if out of stamina

### CMO Blood Effects
- taking damage has a chance to place blood on the ground

### CMO Camera Overhaul
- 3rd person camera follows lazily instead of centering on player

### CMO Dodge
- double-tap on any direction key initiates dodge
- costs stamina and can only be performed if sufficient stamina is left
- dodge moves player into specified direction quickly
- short time of being unpointable

### CMO Movement Fixes
- greatly reduced movability while in the air

### CMO Effects
- vignette effect based on player health
- desaturation based on health, stamina, and mana
- heartbeat sound on low health
