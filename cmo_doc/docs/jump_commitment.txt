# Jump / Fall Commitment
When your character is more than one block above ground, your moveability will be severely reduced.
You can still maneuver as usual on flat ground.
However, jumping / falling off of cliffs or jumping while sprinting will cause this effect to trigger.

You will now mostly keep whatever speed you had when you left the ground.
