# Stamina
Your stamina is now a vital resource for winning melee combat.
Sprinting, dodging, blocking, and even punching will all require stamina and will consume some of it.

Choose wisely which actions to perform. If you run out of stamina, you will be unable to flee quickly and unable to deal damage.
Avoid spam-clicking and misdirected punches as those will drain your bar quickly.
