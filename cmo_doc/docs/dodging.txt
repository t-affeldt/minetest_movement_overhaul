# Dodge Move
Double-tap any direction key (WASD) to perform a dodge.
When dodging, you will perform a fast step into the chosen direction.
Alongside the movement, you will also gain invulnerability from punches for one second.

Dodging costs stamina (by default 20%) and can only be performed while you still have enough points.
You can only dodge while standing on the ground, not in the air or underwater.
You also cannot dodge while the cooldown of a previous dodge move is still active. This is indicated by a timer in the bottom left.
A subtle clicking sound will be played when your attempt failed.
