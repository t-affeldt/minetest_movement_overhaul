# Visual & Sound Effects
Loosing health will affect your vision. The less hitpoints you have left, the less you will be able to see.
If your health gets very low, a heartbeat sound will be played to warn you.
Additionally, consuming stamina or mana will desaturate the screen, giving you a clear indicator when your attributes are low.

New sound effects have been added. You will now be able to clearly distinguish when you have:
- succesfully hit something with a tool
- succesfully punched something without a tool
- missed your target
- attempted an attack while out of stamina

When striking another player, blood particles will be emitted. The amount of blood depends on the amount of damage dealt.
There is also a chance for blood splashes to appear on the ground. They will disappear again after a few seconds.
